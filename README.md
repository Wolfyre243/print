# Introduction
`print` is a VERY AMAZING npm package that lets you code like python without using python!!!
Gone are the days of `console.log()` this and `console.log()` that!
Say hello to the new and improved way of printing in javascript! (yes this is a troll)

# Usage
```js
const print = require('print');

print('Hello World!'); // prints 'Hello World!'
print(1 + 2); // prints '3'
print('Hello', 'World!'); // prints 'Hello World!'
```
